<h3> Multi-objective optimization (Pareto-optimal analysis) for South American Monsoon Precipitation </h3>

This diagnostic metrics demonstrates a multi-objective approach to assess performance of different subset climate models under different objective functions in light of their trade-offs. An example is illustrated to quantify model accuracy in simulating mean precipiation over the California region during boreal winter and associated tropical Pacific SST and mid-latitude zonal wind patterns in a targeting GCM along with multiple CMIP6 model simulations. An algorithm is applied to identify the set of Pareto-optimal model subensembles across these three measures. This approach can be used to determine the best model subset(s) with top performances for desired measurements, for example, for future climate projection studies or large-scale forcing for regional downscaling model simulations.
